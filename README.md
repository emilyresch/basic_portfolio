# resch_homework_2

For this assignment, I created a portfolio, contact, and index.html.
I also created an images folder to hold my pictures (for bio and portfolio)

INDEX
For the home page, I tried to implement the ideas of rows and columns where possible. I had a bit of a challenge on this one but mananged to get the bio image how I wanted it and the text to wrap around it properly. 

CONTACT
This page was a bit trickier. I had to really divvy up some of the different <form> code that I found on bootstrap to create similar input spaces that I saw on the example photos. I believe I achieved the right effect. After working on it I realized that I hadn't used a row/column situation, and after adding that I got the same effect as the photos where the form clings to the left of the page. 

PORTFOLIO
Now this one gave me the most trouble. I ended up starting from scratch on this one so I could fully work through each piece of the page (this is also where I worked on the Navbar to be able to use on the other pages). After getting some advice for the photo cards, I managed to find the sweet spot for size and margins. Unfortunately I was not able to get the images to appear centered on the screen (after a lot of effort and frustration).

NAV/FOOTER/ETC

The navbar was tricky. I started out using the code straight from Bootstrap, but then realized that if I wanted the nav items to appear on the right side of the screen with space in the middle that I would need to make the navbar a grid container as well. After adding this I was able to make my own class and have the nav-items justified to the right/flex-end. I used flex-direction: row; to keep the items in a row when the button is pressed. However I hit another wall here with the CSS - I had trouble gettting space in between the menu items on the smaller screen response. I also couldn't remove the collapsing button without breaking the code, so I kept it in. So I am aware that this part looks a bit awkward but I kept it consistent so it looks purposeful, albeit a bit weird. 
I tried to add the bonus footer. As it was a bonus portion I didn't spend the most time on it. I added it in as a new row. Even with all my Google-fu I had difficulty figuring out the right move to get sticky positioning with bootstrap. So I just threw it in best I could. 
Looking forward to reviewing this assingment to see what I can do better!
